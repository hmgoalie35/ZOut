Add jdialog that pops up if there is data in the credit card or check entries, (preventing the chance user didnt realize 
they have to hit enter to add a credit card or check)

Warning: credit card / checks have not been added yet, do you still want to proceed?

add arraylist of transactions that loads all current transactions in the History.zof file on program startup. if there are no transactions to load, then it doesnt matter
if there are tranasctions to load then this arraylist will be used by the viewtransactionhistorywindow to display
the transactions to the user. 

this will allow me to then allow the user to delete a transaction if they had made a mistake.
