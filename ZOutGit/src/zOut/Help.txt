~~Z-Out Program~~

Coded on - Lenovo T520, Windows 7 64 bit, Eclipse Kepler Java 1.7

~~Any bugs, inquiries or suggestions can be emailed to harris@pittinsky.com

The source code is included in the .jar. Just open the .jar with an unarchiver. Go to the zOut folder
and the source code is the files ending with .java

The javadocs can be viewed by navigating to the JavaDocs folder when the .jar is unzipped and double 
clicking index.html. From here documentation about the code can be accessed by selecting
the appropriate class.

~~ When actually doing the z-out, turn the key to the z and hit the cash out button (bottom right). 
~~ Count the number of each bills/coins and enter them into this program. 
~~ You still have to fill out the sheet with the corresponding amount of bills/coins and how many 
adult residents, skate rentals, etc. there were for the day
~~ Also need to put the money in an envelop, with the date, time, your name, total money amount 
on the outside.

~~ The program also handles checks and credit cards, enter the check amount in the entry box and 
hit the <Enter> key , this will add up all of the checks and then display the total.

~~ The same method will be used for credit card transactions. Simply type the credit card amount 
in the entry box and hit the <Enter> key. 

~~ The program also displays how many credit cards and checks have been added in the rightmost column.
 This is a running total and as checks or credit cards are added they are added. whenever the user
  deletes a credit card or check this number decreases by one. 

====================================================================================

Brief Overview --

This is a simple and easy to use program that allows the user to enter the  
Amount of bills they have counted and the program will perform the rest of the
math for them. 

When the program starts it automatically creates a folder named History. A file called History.zof 
(.zof for Z-Out File) is created in this folder. This file is appended to whenever the user presses 
the Calculate Total button and the resulting total is positive. if the resulting total is negative, 
upon confirmation from the user, the data is written to the file, otherwise no data is written to the file. 

Whenever the program is launched it checks to see if the directory or file already exists so it does not
overwrite them. 

The data in the file is of the form:

Date

Number of Checks: 0
Check Sub-Total: $0.00

Number of Credit Cards: 0
Credit Sub-Total: $0.00

Cash Sub-Total: $0.00

Register Starting Amount: $100.00
Sub-Total: $0.00
Total: $0.00
------------------------------------


In addition there is a properties.txt file that is created the first time the program starts. This file 
stores the default register starting amount. Initially it is $100 but if the user changes the amount
then the file is updated and whenever the program is loaded, the new amount is loaded into the
"Register Amount" entry.
====================================================================================

~~The conversions are done "live" this means that once data is entered, the  
program automatically converts whatever the number may be to its specific  
individual total. ex: when the number 5 is type into the $1 entry, the total under the "Amount" label is
automatically updated to $5.00. If an invalid key is pressed (ex: 'h' or ~ or *) the program displays 
a dialog telling the user an invalid key has been pressed. it then clears the entry so the user can 
reenter any data. 

====================================================================================

**NOTE**
~The register starting amount is the amount of cash that the register started  
with at the beginning of the work day. Typically this value is not to be changed  
unless for some reason an amount other than 100 was in the register to begin  
with. 

To change this value, click the modify button, enter the new value and hit ok, among confirmation 
the value is changed. if the user opts to not change the amount, then the amount is set to the 
previous value that was in the Register Amount entry.
All entries/ buttons except the File menu are disabled until the ok button is pressed.
When this amount is changed the properties.txt file is updated so that whenever
the program is restarted, or launched again, it remembers the last starting
amount the user wanted.  

====================================================================================


~~ The user can simply type in numbers that are valid in the entry boxes and the  
conversions are done live. The corresponding totals are updated on the right  
under the Amount label. 

~~ A subtotal is automatically accumulated when the user enters, or  
deletes numbers. 

***** If there are none of a certain bill/coin you DO NOT need to put a 0 in 
                      the entry box, just leave it blank****

====================================================================================


~~the calculate the total button is always enabled. the user can press it at any time
if for some reason the calculation returns a negative number the program displays a dialog 
to the user asking them if they are sure they entered the correct data, if yes then the total 
is updated and the corresponding information is written to the History.zof file.
if no then the program returns back to it's main screen so the user can input the correct 
data. No information is written to the History.zof file in this case.  

====================================================================================
~~Reset Fields button -- this button resets all of the fields, including the credit cards 
and checks that have been added.
====================================================================================

**File Menu**

~~Restart -- allows the user to restart the program among confirmation if they want. this resets 
all fields. keyboard shortcut - Ctrl + r

~~Help -- opens this file

~~Quit -- closes the program among confirmation. keyboard shortcut - Ctrl + q

**Edit Menu**

the below menu items are disabled until a check or credit card is added. 
they are also disabled when all checks or credit cards have been removed

~~Delete a Credit Card -- allows the user to remove any of the credit card values they added. 
they simply input one of the values in the dialog box and if it exists, it is then removed and the
 corresponding fields are updated. the current list of credit card values that have been added are 
 displayed in the dialog box. 

~~Delete a Check -- allows the user to remove any of the check values they added. they simply 
input one of the values in the dialog box and if it exists, it is then removed and the
corresponding fields are updated. the current list of check values that have been added
are displayed in the dialog box


**Transaction History**

~~View Transaction History -- displays the transactions that have occurred and that are 
stored in the History.zof file. keyboard shortcut - Ctrl + t.
	-  contains a menu bar with a search option which opens up a search dialog so the
	   user can search for any data. 
	
~~Delete Transaction History -- this resets the History.zof file to have nothing in 
it among confirmation from the user. Actually deleting the file would cause 
errors when the program is running, so creating a new clean file of the same name does 
the same trick. 


**The program window is purposely prevented from maximizing***
