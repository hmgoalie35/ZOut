This is a program I created that makes it easier for cashiers to calculate how much money was made in a day.
I am a cashier at my job and I found it repetitive to have to count all of the bills and manually add them on 
paper. This program adds everything for the cashier and keeps a record of all of the transactions that have 
occurred. 

The help.txt file in the src folder has a much more detailed description of this program
